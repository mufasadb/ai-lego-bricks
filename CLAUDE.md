# AI Lego Bricks - Modular Building Blocks for LLM Agents

## Project Overview
AI Lego Bricks is a modular library of building blocks for LLM agentic work, designed to be combined and configured like building blocks. The core philosophy is **JSON-driven configuration over Python code** - almost all behavior should be driven through agent orchestrator JSON files rather than writing Python to configure them.

## The Lego Bricks

### üéØ Agent Orchestrator (Core Brick)
**The central nervous system** - A JSON-driven workflow orchestration system that combines all other bricks into sophisticated AI agents. Define complex multi-step workflows, conditional logic, loops, and human-in-the-loop interactions entirely through configuration files.

**Key Features:**
- JSON-driven workflows (no Python required for most use cases)
- Conditional routing and loops
- Multi-modal processing pipelines
- Streaming support with real-time responses
- Human approval workflows

### üí¨ Chat Services
**Conversation engine** - Unified chat interfaces supporting multiple LLM providers (Gemini, Ollama, OpenAI, Anthropic). Choose between stateless quick interactions or stateful multi-turn conversations with full history management.

### üß† Memory Services  
**Long-term knowledge** - Semantic memory system with vector embeddings and graph storage. Automatically store and retrieve relevant context using similarity search across Neo4j and Supabase backends.

### üõ†Ô∏è Tools & MCP Integration
**External capabilities** - Universal tool execution framework with full MCP (Model Context Protocol) integration. Automatically discover and use external tools with secure credential management.

### üó£Ô∏è Text-to-Speech (TTS)
**Voice output** - Multi-provider TTS with streaming support. Convert LLM responses to natural speech using OpenAI, Google, or local Coqui-XTTS models.

### üé§ Speech-to-Text (STT)
**Voice input** - Speech recognition services for audio-based interactions. Transform voice input into text for processing by other bricks.

### üìÑ PDF & Visual Processing
**Document intelligence** - Extract text from PDFs, images, and visual content. Supports OCR, bounding box extraction, table parsing, and AI-powered visual analysis.

### üî§ Text Chunking
**Content preparation** - Intelligent text segmentation for large documents. Optimize content for vector storage and LLM context windows.

### üé® Image Generation
**Visual creation** - AI-powered image generation using multiple providers. Create visual content programmatically within agent workflows.

### üìù Prompt Management
**Prompt engineering** - Versioned prompt templates with A/B testing, execution tracking, and dynamic variable substitution using Jinja2.

### üîê Credential Management
**Secure configuration** - Centralized, secure storage and retrieval of API keys and sensitive configuration across all services.

### üìä Visualizer
**Workflow debugging** - Generate visual diagrams of agent workflows for debugging and documentation purposes.

## Core Design Principle: JSON-Driven Configuration

The fundamental principle of AI Lego Bricks is that **behavior should be driven through agent orchestrator JSON files**, not Python code. This means:

‚úÖ **Preferred Approach**: Define agents in JSON configuration files
```json
{
  "name": "DocumentAnalysisAgent",
  "steps": [
    {"type": "pdf_to_text", "input": "document_path"},
    {"type": "chunking", "chunk_size": 1000},
    {"type": "memory_store", "metadata": {"type": "document"}},
    {"type": "llm_analysis", "provider": "gemini", "model": "gemini-1.5-flash"},
    {"type": "tts", "voice": "alloy"}
  ]
}
```

‚ùå **Avoid**: Writing Python code to configure each agent manually

This approach provides:
- **Rapid prototyping** - Create new agents in minutes
- **Non-technical accessibility** - Business users can modify agent behavior  
- **Version control** - Track agent evolution through JSON diffs
- **Reusability** - Share and compose agent templates
- **Debugging** - Clear workflow visualization and step-by-step execution

## Getting Started

1. **Explore The Brick Books** - Each brick has detailed documentation in `/The Brick Books/` folder
2. **Check examples** - See `/agent_orchestration/examples/` for JSON workflow templates
3. **Use the CLI** - `ailego` command provides scaffolding and templates
4. **Start with JSON** - Build agents through configuration, not code

## Documentation Structure

- **CLAUDE.md** files in each brick folder contain detailed technical guides for Claude
- **The Brick Books/** contains user-facing documentation for each brick
- **claude-knowledge/** contains general guides and architectural overviews

## Security & Credentials

All bricks follow secure credential patterns - no hardcoded API keys in configuration files. Use the credential management brick for secure, centralized credential storage.

## Philosophy

Think of this as "Infrastructure as Configuration" for AI agents - the power of complex agentic workflows through simple, declarative JSON files that combine pre-built, tested building blocks.
