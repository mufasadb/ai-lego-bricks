## üìù For Users

Users don't typically need to read these files directly. For getting started with the project, see:
- **Main project documentation:** `README.md` 
- **Setup instructions:** `setup/README.md`
- **Supabase setup:** `setup/SUPABASE_SETUP.md`

## üîÑ Maintenance

These files should be updated whenever:
- Project structure changes significantly
- New features or services are added
- Development guidelines or philosophy evolves
- Setup procedures are modified
- Agent orchestration capabilities are enhanced

This helps ensure Claude has current and accurate information about the project context.
